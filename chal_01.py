# Take the following lists

dogs = ["fido", "spot", "lucky"]

cats = ["fluffy", "snowball", "garfield"]

# And combine them into a list called pets.


# Part 2

# Using the same lists from above,
# create a dictionary called my_pets
# that has the keys of 'dogs' and 'cats'
# with the values being the appropriate
# lists.


# Part 3

# Prove you can use the pets list to print
# "I only own spot and snowball"
